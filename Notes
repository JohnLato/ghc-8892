trac-8892 test case notes

1.  The issue is triggered by installing the package "piecewise", then
    attempting to compile "ghc -O2 Broken.hs".

Compilation succeeds if any of these are true:

    Piecewise.hs is compiled in the same pass as Broken.hs (instead of
    installed via a package)

    Compile Broken.hs with -O1 or lower

    Compile Piecewise.hs with -O0

    Piecewise.hs is modified as noted in that file.
